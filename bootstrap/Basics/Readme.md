# Bootstrap || Containers

## Containers

* Bootstrap requires a containing element to wrap site contents.

* Containers are used to pad the content inside of them, and there are two container classes:

--- 1. The ```.container``` class ==> it provides a responsive fixed width container.

--- 2. The ```.container-fluid``` class ==> it provides a full width container, spanning the entire width of the viewport.

## Fixed container

* use the ```.container``` class to create a responsive, fixed-width container.

* Note that its width(```max-width```) will change on different screen sizes:


          | Extra small <576px    | Small >= 567px    | Medium >= 768px   | Large >= 992px    | Extra large >= 1200px
----------|-----------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------------
max-width |     100%              |     540px         |     720px         |     960px         |     1140px
